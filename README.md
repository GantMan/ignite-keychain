# ignite-keychain

Hello, and thanks for reading :smile:

This plugin adds [react-native-keychain](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-keychain) to your [ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) project.

The keychain is used on mobile devices to store sensitive data you might not want to have hang around in async storage or redux state.

### Installation
`ignite add ignite-keychain`

No, really. thats it.

### Useful Things to know

* Ships with example code. Just say `Y` at the prompt!

* This plugin targets the `ignite-ir-boilerplate-2016` boilerplate. You can use it without this boilerplate, but the example code won't be copied.

Thanx to [oblador](https://github.com/oblador/) for `react-native-keychain`, and to [Steve Kellock](https://github.com/skellock/), [Gant Laborde](https:/github.com/gantman) and [Jamon Holmgren](https://github.com/jamonholmgren) from [infinite red](https://infinite.red/) for being generally awesome. :trumpet:
